Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The objective is to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. NLP involves enabling machines to understand, interpret, and produce human language in a way that is both valuable and meaningful. OpenAI, known for developing advanced language models like ChatGPT, highlights the importance of NLP in creating intelligent systems that can understand, respond to, and generate text, making technology more user-friendly and accessible.
