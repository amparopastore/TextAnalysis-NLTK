# NLP: Text Analysis Using NLTK

## Project Overview

This project is part of an assignment for the Natural Language Processing course (CAP6640). It demonstrates the use of the NLTK library to preprocess text data (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming), calculates Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for text documents, and computes cosine similarity between multiple documents.

## Features
1. Text Preprocessing
   - Tokenization of documents.
   - Removal of stop words (using NLTK's stop word list and punctuation marks).
   - Stemming using the PortStemmer.
  
2. TF-IDF Calculation
   - Conmpute the TF-IDF matrix for a corpus of documents.
  
3. Cosine Similarity
   - Calculates pairwise cosine similarity between the documents in the corpus to measure how similar they are.
